This Verilog project implements a Dual Port RAM design. The dual-port RAM has two independent read and write ports, allowing simultaneous read and write operations.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a dual-port RAM module that supports the following functionalities:
- Independent read and write operations on two separate ports.
- Simultaneous read and write operations without blocking each other.

## Features

- Dual-port architecture for parallel read and write operations.
- Supports simultaneous read and write accesses to different memory locations.
- Designed to minimize read/write conflicts and ensure data consistency.

## Files

- `Dual_Port_RAM.v`: Main Verilog module for the dual-port RAM design.
- `Dual_Port_RAM_Tb.v`: Testbench module for simulation.

## Simulation

1. Open the simulation tool provided by your Verilog IDE.
2. Add the project files and the testbench.
3. Compile and simulate the design.
4. Observe the waveforms to verify the functionality of the dual-port RAM design.

This Verilog project implements a ROM (Read-Only Memory) design. A ROM is a memory component that stores data which can only be read and not written to.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a ROM module that supports the following functionalities:
- Storage of pre-defined data values.
- Address decoding to access stored data.
- Read operations to retrieve data based on the given address.
